The PowerShell pipeline allows you to pass the output of one command as the input to another command, creating a streamlined way to process data and objects.

#### **Pipeline Basics:**
```powershell
Command1 | Command2
```
Here, `Command1` generates an object, and the `|` (pipe) sends that object as input to `Command2`.

### **Common Cmdlets and Aliases Used in Pipelines**

#### 1. **Get-Service and Restart-Service**
You can use the pipeline to restart a service by retrieving it with `Get-Service` and piping it into `Restart-Service`:
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | Restart-Service
Get-Service XboxGipSvc | Stop-Service
```

#### 2. **Format-Table (`ft`) and Format-List (`fl`)**
By default, PowerShell outputs data as a table. You can explicitly format it using `Format-Table` or `Format-List`.

##### Example: Format as a Table
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | Format-Table
```

##### Example: Format as a List
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | Format-List
```

##### Example: Use Alias (`ft` for `Format-Table`)
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | ft
```

---

### **Filtering Data Using Where-Object (`Where` or `?`)**
The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters objects in the pipeline based on conditions. You can use the full cmdlet name, the alias `Where`, or `?`.

##### Example 1: Full `Where-Object` Cmdlet
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*chrome*" }
```

##### Example 2: Using `Where` Alias
```powershell
Get-Process | Where { $_.Name -like "*chrome*" }
```

##### Example 3: Using `?` Alias
```powershell
Get-Process | ? { $_.Name -like "*chrome*" }
```

Here, `$_` refers to the current object in the pipeline.

---

### **ForEach-Object and Aliases**
You can use `ForEach-Object` to act on each object in the pipeline. The alias for `ForEach-Object` is `%`.

##### Example 1: Full `ForEach-Object`
```powershell
Get-Service | ForEach-Object { $_.Status }
```

##### Example 2: Using `%` Alias
```powershell
Get-Service | % { $_.Status }
```

---

### **Exporting Data to CSV**
You can export the output of a pipeline to a CSV file using `Export-Csv`. Itâ€™s useful for saving data for further analysis.

##### Example:
```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Processes.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
This command retrieves processes, selects the `Name` and `Id` properties, and exports them to a CSV file.

---

### **Using Select-Object to Control Output**
`Select-Object` allows you to specify which properties of the object to display in the output.

##### Example: Select Specific Properties
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | Select-Object DisplayName, Status
```

##### Example: Using the Alias `Select`
```powershell
Get-Service spooler | Select DisplayName, Status
```

---

### **Pipeline Variable: `$_`**
The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline, which can be used in commands like `Where-Object` or `ForEach-Object`.

##### Example:
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*chrome*" }
```

This filters services where the name contains "chrome."

---

### **Combining Multiple Pipelines**
You can combine multiple pipelines to format, filter, and act on data in a sequence.

##### Example: Multiple Pipelines
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "Stopped" } | Format-List
```
This command retrieves services, filters to show only those that are stopped, and formats the output as a list.

##### Example: Exporting Filtered Data to CSV
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*chrome*" } | Select-Object Name, Id | Export-Csv -Path "C:\NotepadProcesses.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

---

### **Using Wildcards in the Pipeline**
You can use wildcards (`*`) in conditions to match partial strings in filtering.

##### Example:
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*win*" }
```
This retrieves all services where the name contains "win."

---

### **Advanced Example: Using Multiple Pipes**
You can combine pipes for advanced processing, such as retrieving, filtering, and formatting data in one sequence.

##### Example:
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "Stopped" } | Select-Object Name, Status | Export-Csv -Path "C:\StoppedServices.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
This retrieves stopped services, selects specific properties (`Name` and `Status`), and exports the data to a CSV file.
