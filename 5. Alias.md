**Aliases** are shortcuts for cmdlets or commands in PowerShell that make scripts shorter and easier to read. Microsoft has included many built-in aliases, so you can use shorter commands instead of writing out the full cmdlet name.

### **Viewing Aliases**
To **view all aliases**, you can use the cmdlet:
  ```powershell
  Get-Alias
  ```

To **view a specific alias** by definition (the actual cmdlet):
  ```powershell
  Get-Alias -Definition ForEach-Object
  ```
  Output: `ForEach-Object` has two aliases: `%` and `ForEach`.

To **find aliases that match a specific name pattern** using a wildcard:
  ```powershell
  Get-Alias -Name f*
  ```
This command will return all aliases that start with "f," such as `Format-List`, `Format-Table`, etc.

### **Filtering Aliases**
You can filter aliases using the **`Where-Object`** cmdlet, which allows you to apply conditions to the search results. The `$_` represents the current object being processed by the pipeline.

  ```powershell
  Get-Alias | Where-Object { $_.Version -ne $null }
  ```
This checks if the alias's version is not null, though in this case, many aliases don't have version numbers, so it returns no results.

### **Common Aliases Examples**
- **`ForEach-Object`**: Alias can be `%` or `ForEach`.
- **`Where-Object`**: Alias can be `?` or `Where`.
- **`Get-Process`**: Aliases are `GPS` or `PS`.
- **`Get-Alias`**: Alias is `Gal`.
