### **ForEach-Object Loop in PowerShell**
`ForEach-Object` is used in pipelines to process each item as it passes through.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | ForEach-Object { $_.Name }
```
This command gets the files and folders in a directory and uses `ForEach-Object` to print the name of each.

In PowerShell, the `%` symbol is an alias for the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet. It is commonly used in pipelines to process each item in a collection or result set, and it's a shorthand that makes code more concise.
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | % { $_.Name }

$numbers = 1..5
$numbers | % { Write-Host "Number: $_" } # Will outputs from 1 to 5
```

##### Syntax:
```powershell
Command | ForEach-Object { $_ }
```
`$_` represents the current object in the pipeline.

##### Example:
```powershell
$colors = @("Red", "Green", "Blue")
$colors | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ }
```
This outputs each color to the console.

### **ForEach Loop in PowerShell**
The `ForEach` loop is used to iterate over a collection of objects (like arrays).

##### Syntax:
```powershell
ForEach ($item in $collection) {
    # Code to execute for each item
}
```

##### Example:
```powershell
$colors = @("Red", "Green", "Blue")
ForEach ($color in $colors) {
    Write-Host $color
}
```
This iterates through the `$colors` array and prints each color.

```powershell
$colors = @("Red", "Green", "Blue")
% ($color in $colors) {
    Write-Host $color
}
```

---

### **For Loop in PowerShell**
A `For` loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to iterate over a block of code.

##### Syntax:
```powershell
For ($i = 0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
    # Code to execute
}
```

##### Example:
```powershell
For ($i = 0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
    Write-Host "Iteration: $i"
}
```
This will output "Iteration: 0" through "Iteration: 4".

---

### **While Loop in PowerShell**
The `While` loop continues to run as long as the specified condition evaluates to `$true`.

##### Syntax:
```powershell
While ($condition) {
    # Code to execute
}
```

##### Example:
```powershell
$i = 0
While ($i -lt 5) {
    Write-Host "Iteration: $i"
    $i++
}
```
This loops while `$i` is less than 5, incrementing `$i` on each iteration.

---

### **Do While Loop in PowerShell**
A `Do While` loop is similar to `While`, but it guarantees at least one execution because the condition is checked after the loop.

##### Syntax:
```powershell
Do {
    # Code to execute
} While ($condition)
```

##### Example:
```powershell
$i = 0
Do {
    Write-Host "Iteration: $i"
    $i++
} While ($i -lt 5)
```
This will run the loop as long as `$i` is less than 5, starting at 0.

---

### **Do Until Loop in PowerShell**
The `Do Until` loop runs until a specified condition evaluates to `$true`. It guarantees at least one execution, even if the condition starts as true.

##### Syntax:
```powershell
Do {
    # Code to execute
} Until ($condition)
```

##### Example:
```powershell
$i = 0
Do {
    Write-Host "Iteration: $i"
    $i++
} Until ($i -ge 5)
```
This loop continues until `$i` is greater than or equal to 5.

---

Each of these loops serves a unique purpose depending on the context of your script and the type of iteration required. Use `ForEach` and `ForEach-Object` for collections, `For` when you know the number of iterations, and `While/Do While/Do Until` for condition-based loops.
