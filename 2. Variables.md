In PowerShell, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in your scripts.

There are some illegal characters and PowerShell will throw an error if you use one of these characters in your variables.
```PowerShell 
@ ! & # % , . and spaces
```

##### PowerShell Variable Template:
```powershell
$VariableName = Value
```

###### Examples of Variables in PowerShell:

#### 1. **String Variable**
```powershell
$greeting = "Hello, World!"
```
This assigns the string `"Hello, World!"` to the variable `$greeting`.

#### 2. **Integer Variable**
```powershell
$number = 10
```
This assigns the integer `10` to the variable `$number`.

#### 3. **Array Variable**
```powershell
$colors = @("Red", "Green", "Blue")
```
This assigns an array of strings `@("Red", "Green", "Blue")` to the variable `$colors`.

#### 4. **Boolean Variable**
```powershell
$isReady = $true
```
This assigns the boolean value `$true` to the variable `$isReady`.

#### 5. **Hash Table Variable**
```powershell
$person = @{
    Name = "John Doe"
    Age = 30
    Occupation = "Engineer"
}
```
This assigns a hash table (associative array) to the variable `$person` with keys and values.

#### 6. **Null Variable**
```powershell
$nothing = $null
```
This assigns `$null` (no value) to the variable `$nothing`.

#### 7. **Automatic Variable**
```powershell
$PSVersionTable
```
This is an automatic variable that stores information about the PowerShell version and environment.

##### Using Variables in Commands:
Once a variable is defined, you can use it in your PowerShell commands. For example:

```powershell
Write-Host $greeting  # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

```powershell
$sum = $number + 5
Write-Host $sum  # Outputs: 15
```

```PowerShell
Get-Host $colors[0] # Outputs Red
```

```PowerShell
$person["Name"] # Outputs John Doe
```

```PowerShell
$person["Age"] = 35 # Will change the age variable to 35
$person.Add("Height", 180) # Will add new variable to the hash table
$person.Remove("Height") # Will remove new variable to the hash table
$person.Clear() # Will clear everything in the hash table
```

##### Variable Types:
You can specify the type of a variable explicitly, although PowerShell is dynamically typed by default.

###### Example of a Typed Variable:
```powershell
[int]$count = 50
```
This forces the variable `$count` to be of type integer (`[int]`).

##### Variable Scopes:
PowerShell variables have different scopes (e.g., Global, Local, Script). You can define a global variable like this:
```powershell
$Global:globalVariable = "This is a global variable"
```


##### Special Variable Template:
These special variables are automatically set by PowerShell and give you access to useful information like the current pipeline object, error information, and paths to important directories.

##### 1. **`$_`** — Contains the Current Pipeline Object
**Description**: `$_` holds the current object in the pipeline. It is often used within `ForEach-Object` or `Where-Object` commands.
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1MB }
```
This filters files in the current directory where the file size is greater than 1MB. `$_` represents each file object passed through the pipeline.

##### 2. **`$Args`** — Contains an Array of Parameters
**Description**: `$Args` stores any arguments passed to a script or function as an array.
```powershell
function Show-Arguments {
    Write-Host "You passed the following arguments:"
    $Args | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ }
}

Show-Arguments "arg1" "arg2" "arg3"
```
When the `Show-Arguments` function is called with `"arg1" "arg2" "arg3"`, `$Args` contains these values, which are then printed.

##### 3. **`$Error`** — Contains Objects for Which an Error Occurred
**Description**: `$Error` is an array that stores details of errors that have occurred in the current session. The most recent error is `$Error[0]`.
```powershell
Get-Item "C:\nonexistentfile.txt"  # This will produce an error

# Check the most recent error
Write-Host "Most recent error: $($Error[0])"
```
This will try to get a non-existent file, generate an error, and then display the most recent error using `$Error[0]`.

##### 4. **`$Home`** — Specifies the User's Home Directory
**Description**: `$Home` contains the path to the current user’s home directory.
```powershell
Write-Host "Your home directory is: $Home"
```
This outputs the path to the user’s home directory, typically `C:\Users\YourUsername`.

##### 5. **`$PsHome`** — PowerShell's Installation Path
**Description**: `$PsHome` holds the directory path where PowerShell is installed.
```powershell
Write-Host "PowerShell is installed at: $PsHome"
```
This shows the directory where PowerShell is installed, typically something like
